      <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?<br><span></span></h3>
      <p>AI is the ability of a machine to perform cognitive functions as humans do, such as perceiving, learning, reasoning and solving problems. AI provides a cutting-edge technology to deal with complex data which is near to impossible to handle by a human being. AI automates redundant jobs, allowing a worker to focus on the high level, strategic, value-adding tasks. When AI is implemented at scale, it leads to cost reduction and revenue increase.
      </p>
      <h2>What are the types of AI?</h2>
      <p> 

     <h3>Reactive Machines</h3>
      <p>These types of machines can only give responses from a contained set of inputs. They don’t improve their responses based on new data or their memory as they also don’t have memory based functionality. </p>

      <h3>Limited Memory </h3>
      <p>This technology takes reactive machines but adds the previously missing data of learning from past / inputted data to make choices.  The AI that we have become accustomed to today uses this to make decisions. One of the biggest examples of this is AI image recognition. This uses thousands of images to identify objects that it scans, so it’s able to label the object with increasing accuracy. </p>

      <h3>Theory of Mind </h3>
      <p>This type of AI is more focusing on understanding more ‘human’ concepts such as emotions, thoughts, and beliefs. Today, theory of mind is still a very broad research topic, and is still a concept that researchers have been unable to make possible. </p>

      <h3>Self-Aware </h3>
      <p>This type of AI is the most human-like type of technology, as it would be able to have its own thoughts, feelings, emotions and beliefs. It would be able to interact with people as people do. However, this type of technology is still very very far from actually being developed. As Limited Memory is still the fore-runner for AI, there is still a long way to go before Self-Aware AI comes into play.

      <h2>What is AI used for?<br><span></span></h2>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <h3>1.Maps and Navigation<br><span></span></h3>
      <p>Before the 21st century, satellite-based GPS was the only way for navigation aside from paper maps. Now Google or even apple maps can give directions with a few clicks. As AI is used throughout the system to determine roads, where traffic lights are and even traffic, GPS isn’t used as frequently or on demand. Instead the machine learning, and algorithms, along with the images that come with an app like google maps has all been made possible from the use of AI. Not to mention the AI that's integrated for calculating traffic, as it changes throughout the day. It takse in data from the posted speed roads, how fast the cars that are using google maps are going, and uses data to calculate the optimal route for you with the least amount of traffic.

      </p>
          
      <p>

      </p>
        
      <h3>2. Facial Detection and Recognition<br><span></span></h3>
      <p>Ever think about how you can use facial recognition to unlock your phone, or how filters can be put onto our faces when using apps like snapchat or instagram? AI has the ability to make the choices based on photos you’ve uploaded to your phone, and determine whether you’re a match or not. Face detection is also used for many other purposes including surveillance, and even security by government agencies, private companies, and especially airports. 
      </p>
      <h3>3. Text Editors or Autocorrect<br><span></span></h3>
      <p>Grammarly, and other tools to correct grammar, or to rephrase a sentence is also AI. Through the development of machine and deep learning algorithms along with natural language processing, apps are now able to identify spelling issues, grammar, and even re-write your entire sentence. It can catch incorrectly used characters like commas that are where they shouldn’t be, and dashes that don’t make sense. Thousands of people use these tools for papers, research, and documentation, making the applications of AI more used, and needed than ever. 

      </p>  
      <h3> 4. Chatbots<br><span></span></h3>
      <p>Chatbots are an all time favourite when it comes to companies trying to cut back expenses on customer service. They are found on many websites, and are now a requirement for larger companies. These chatbots are able to answer FAQs, take orders, and calls, while keeping track of their progress. Are able to imitate normal conversations to replicate customer service. In fact, Chatbots have become so advanced that they can answer complex, long questions without the answer of yes or no. Instead, they are able to give proper answers that customers can get faster in comparison to regular customer service. They can change their answer when you tell it that their answer isn’t the one you’re looking for, and chatbots have a wide range of answers and capabilities, increasing overall client satisfaction.
      </p>
 
      <h3>   5. Social Media<br><span></span></h3>
      <p>Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and many other applications use AI. They can be used to scan content, make connection suggestions, make certain ads pop up based on your roaming, and what you’ve been clicking, or spending more time looking at. AI is one of the biggest contributors to the addictive aspect of social media, and this is due to its keyword intelligence, and image recognition, as it is able to send more items, more images, and more videos to keep customers engaged in their app. It uses neural network architecture, and deep learning to fully understand what to recommend to users. And this technique has worked for the past few years very well, as social media apps, such as Instagram, SnapChat, and the most recent addictive app TikTok, make billions of dollars each year.
